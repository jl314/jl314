# Li Jiang's Home Page

I am a first-year graduate student in [Division of Psychology and Language Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). Prior to UCL, I received my B.A.Hons in Linguistics and Sociology from [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk).
 
## Research Interests
My research interests broadly lie in the fileds of _neurolinguistics_ and _psycholinguistics_. I am passionate about studying _speech perception_ and _language acquisition_.

I combine _linguistic theories_, _neuroimaging techniques_, and _behavioural studies_ to measure and understand _human language comprehension and learning_, with the goal of probing into a pile of intriguing but formidable problems, such as the _Nature versus Nurture debate_, _language learning biases_, and _crossmodal capacity_.

## Current Experience
Research Assistant at [_VoCoLab_](http://www.carolynmcgettigan.com), University College London, UK  
_Supervised by [Prof. Carolyn McGettigan](http://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=CMCGE61) on voice-face matching._

<!-- Experiment Assistant at University of Manchester, UK
